                            Your contract with us will be formed when we receive your sell order. It will incorporate these terms and conditions and our terms of use. Please click on the "How It Works" page for more information.<br>
                            You must own all rights, title and interests in any phone(s) and/or devices (inc. Tablets and Watches) that you send to us.<br>
                            Ownership of the device(s) will pass to us when we receive them, in accordance with these terms and conditions, and we have dispatched payment to you, when, hence, a contract will be formed.<br>
                            The contract between you and us is binding on you and us and on our respective successors and assigns.<br>

                            Please remember that by sending your device to us, you agree to release us from all and any claims, losses or damages with respect to the device, any data stored or contained therein or on any media used in conjunction with the device (whether in the form of personal details, SMS, photos, games, songs or other data ("Data")). We accept no responsibility in relation to the security, protection, confidentiality or use of such data and it is your responsibility to ensure so far as practicable that Data is removed from the device prior to you sending it to us.<br><br>
                            Although in our experience the risk of Data left on your device being accessed by us or by any third party to whom we subsequently sell the device are very low, we draw to your attention the following points which will help you decide whether to accept the risk of selling us a device which may contain accessible Data.<br><br>
                            If your device is functional, we strongly advise that you delete all personal data from the device prior to sending it to us<br><br>
                            If your device is non-functional and has a "remote wipe" function, then we strongly advise that you attempt wiping the device prior to sending it to us.<br><br>
                            If your non-functional device cannot be data wiped but has a PIN lock (a password or combination which needs to be entered to access the phone when switched on) then this will block third party access and mean that anyone repairing the device will be required to return the phone to its factory settings, in the process wiping the Data held on the device.<br><br>
                            Please note it may not be possible to delete Data directly from a non-functioning device. If you send us a non-functioning device you are therefore accepting the risk that it may still contain Data which may be accessible to any person who repairs the phone. This may include third parties to whom we have sold the device for spare parts.<br><br>
                            Please note that while (as stated above) we do not accept any liability in respect of the security, protection, confidentiality or use of Data included on any device, as a matter of practice we do not transfer any device to any third party except on terms which require them to wipe that Data.<br><br>

                            Selling a mobile phone or device which you do not own may amount to a criminal offence. We will check the IMEI/Serial number of all mobile phones and devices received on Phonecheck (www.phonecheck.com) to ensure no lost or stolen items are purchased.<br><br>
                            If a mobile phone or device is found to have a record that indicates it has been lost or stolen or we become aware of any other issue relating to its ownership, we will notify the seller by email and quarantine the mobile phone or device for an initial period of 28 days ("the Quarantine Period"). Payment for the mobile phone or device will be withheld by us until the Phonecheck does not show the mobile phone as stolen or lost.<br><br>
                            In such circumstances you will be required to prove that you are the rightful owner of the mobile phone or device and have the lost or stolen records associated with it cleared within the Quarantine Period and/or resolve any other issue relating to its ownership.<br><br>
                            If during the Quarantine Period the mobile phone or device is cleared on the Phonecheck database and any other issue relating to ownership of the same is resolved, your sale will be processed and paid for as normal.<br><br>
                            However, where the mobile phone or device is not cleared on Phonecheck within the Quarantine Period, we will be required by law to hold onto the mobile phone or device, pass it to the Police or other law enforcement body or dispose of it, and by entering into this contract, you expressly agree to this action. You will not receive any payment if such steps are taken.<br><br>
                            UK legislation states that we cannot under any circumstances return or pay for a mobile phone or device which is lost, stolen or recorded as such.<br><br>
                            If you have received payment from us for a mobile phone or device which we subsequently become aware of an issue relating to ownership, you agree to immediately reimburse us in full, within 3 business days following a written request by us, for any such payment pending an investigation by us or any law enforcement body into ownership of the device or mobile phone.<br><br>
                            We shall be entitled to set-off any sums properly due and owing to us under any contract made between you and us incorporating these terms and conditions against any sums owed by us to you under the same or any other contract between us. We will inform you in writing of any set-off carried out by us pursuant to this provision.<br><br>
                            If we at any time become aware of any issues relating to the ownership of the mobile phone or device, you agree to co-operate with us fully with a view to resolving the issues. You may also be contacted by the Police and/or other law enforcement authorities.<br><br>
                            We may disclose seller details to the Police or other authorised bodies (such as, but not limited to, network operators and insurance companies) for the purpose of investigating or preventing a crime. By entering into this contract you agree to us supplying data to the police or other authorised bodies for the purpose of the prevention and detection of crime, arrest and prosecution of offenders or for the recovery of stolen property.<br><br>

Payment for the mobile phone or device will be withheld by us until Phonecheck does not show the mobile phone as AssetWatch.<br><br>
                            In such circumstances you will be required to prove that you are the rightful owner of the mobile phone or device and to pay an administrative fee of £15.00 to Bamboo Mobile within the Quarantine Period before we can send the mobile phone or device back to you within 3 to 5 working days.
