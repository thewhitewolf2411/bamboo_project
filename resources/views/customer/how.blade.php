            <h3>Why Recycling Mobile Phones Is Important </h3>
        </div>
        <div class="why-content-text">
            <p>
            The Social and Environmental Benefits of Mobile Phone Reuse and Recycling
            </p>
            <p>
            Every year, millions of mobile phones are needlessly thrown away.
            </p>
            <p>
            Many of these are in perfectly good working order; many more could be fixed, refurbished and resold, whilst the rest can be reprocessed, the valuable components removed and the
            rest disposed of in a way which has minimal environmental impact.
            </p>
            <p>
            But why should it matter to you what happens to an old mobile phone? Well, here are a few things to think about:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>The cadmium in just three mobile phone batteries is enough to pollute an Olympic sized swimming pool.
            </li>
            <li>The plastic in a typical mobile phone can take up to 1000 years to biodegrade.
            </li>
            <li>Some mobile phones and their accessories contain substances that are amongst the 10 most dangerous known to man including Cadmium, Rhodium, Palladium, Beryllium and Lead
            Solder. Simply throwing out unwanted or old mobile phones is harmful for the environment as there is the potential for considerable toxic contamination caused by these substances
            leaking into the surrounding soil
            </li>
            <li>One thing that most people don't realize is that the toxins that end up in the landfills from these types of electronics are dangerous to everyone. They can end up getting
            into the water; they can harm the wildlife, and more. This only goes to show how important mobile phone recycling really is.
            </li>
            <li>Developing countries that do not have easy access to the technology we have can use those old mobile phones, giving them access to telecommunications as a lower price.
            </li>
            <li>It is estimated that over 5 billion mobile phones have been produced.
            </li>
            <li>Research suggests that there are over 20 million potentially toxic redundant mobile phones in the UK, making up one to two percent of electronic waste.
            </li>
            <li>People in the UK change their phone on average every 12 months. As more and more new phones come on the market this number is set to grow.
            </li>
            <li>Old mobile phones don't need to end up in a landfill site. There are many ways in which you can recycle your old mobile phone and be environmentally friendly at the same time.
            </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reasons Why You Should Sell Your Old Phone </h3>
        </div>

        <div class="reasons-list-container">

            <ol class="reasons_why">
                <li class="one"><span class="number">1.</span><p>It's an incredibly intensive process to make a mobile phone. Each phone utilizes important resources and immense energy in its manufacture. The parts of even the most undesirable phone are still valuable. By recycling phones we could lessen the impact of the mobile phone manufacturing process on the environment.</p></li>
                <li class="two"><span class="number">2.</span><p>Many second hand phones are used in the developing world where many people would be unable to afford full price handsets. By selling your phone you could be helping people get access to vital technology. Reusing phones also means fewer need have to be manufactured, again reducing damage to the environment.</p></li>
                <li class="three"><span class="number">3.</span><p>Financially, selling your mobile makes sense. A handset in reasonably good condition could make more than you think. It's a complete waste of money if you just leave it in a drawer. In these times of economic uncertainty any extra cash is a real help. Considering how easy it is, there's no excuse not to do it. </p></li>
